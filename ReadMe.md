#Map4Nepal@Stanford Resources	
##A link page for humanitarian mapping resources in response to the Nepal Earthquake

###Mapping4Nepal@Stanford Introductory Workshops
I'll be updating this page as I schedule new workshops to introduce volunteers to the basics of using the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Task Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) and the [Tomnod](http://www.tomnod.com/campaign/nepal_earthquake_2015/map/3f8x29y15) to contribute to relief mapping for Nepal.

###The first Introduction to OpenStreetMap.org and the Task Manager will be held **TONIGHT, Monday April 27th, from 6pm to 7pm**

This page is really just intended to be a spot for me to put links to the resources I am paying attention to and using as I help volunteers at Stanford to humanitarian mapping in response to the Nepal Earthquake. If you find it useful, that's great. It's not authoritative, comprehensive or static.

Email me at stacemaples@stanford.edu if you need to.

###Stanford Geospatial Center Teaching Corner Map4Nepal@Stanford Co-location & Support
Beginning at Noon, today (Monday, April 27th)I will be relocating from my office to the **Stanford Geospatial Center Teaching Corner** in order to help support those who are interested in contributing to mapping efforts for disaster relief, in Nepal. The Stanford Geospatial Center Teaching Corner is located in the Northwest Corner of the Mitchell Earth Science Building, on the 2nd floor, in the Branner Earth Sciences Library. 

Anyone with a laptop and spare time is welcome to come to the Library and any of the **Introductory Relief Mapping** sessions I will be holding. ***You do not need to be a Stanford Affiliate!*** If you are not a Stanford affiliate, we can connect you to the Stanford Guest WiFi to work on relief mapping, or participate in the workshops.

[Here is a map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=37.42656&mlon=-122.17287#map=19/37.42656/-122.17287): http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=37.42656&mlon=-122.17287#map=19/37.42656/-122.17287

####Stanford Geospatial Center Teaching Corner Hours for Map4Nepal@Stanford
I am blocking off the schedule for the SGC Teaching Corner for the week. If you would like to co-locate and contribute to mapping, here are the hours the teaching corner will be available. I will be out of town over the weekend, but depending on need and interest, I may continue **Teaching Corner Hours** nest week, as well. *Please note that food is not allowed in the library facilities, but drinks in spill-proof containers are acceptable.*

**Teaching Corner Hours:**  
**Monday - Thursday**: 9am - 9pm  
**Friday** 9am - 5pm

#Basic Information for Contributing **RIGHT NOW**  
If you want to contribute IMMEDIATELY to ongoing Humanitarian Mapping efforts for Nepal through Humanitarian OpenStreetMap.org, please do the following:

Go through the 30 minute training on http://mapgive.state.gov to learn the basics of humanitarian mapping using OpenStreetMap.org

Then go to the HOTOSM Task Manager at http://tasks.hotosm.org/ and select a job that you feel comfortable contributing to. Read the directions carefully for the job, then select one of the squares next to one that is marked as complete. This will allow you to pan to the completed square so you can see how others are digitizing the features and mimic their work. 

It doesn't matter how long you work, or how many features you digitize. There are currently hundreds of people mapping on HOTOSM for the Nepal Earthquake.Every edit counts.
 
You can also help assess damage, as new imagery becomes available. See [this DigitalGlobe post](http://www.digitalglobeblog.com/2015/04/26/digitalglobe-opens-access-to-satellite-data-to-support-disaster-response-efforts-in-nepal/) for information:

##Obtaining the latest OSM Data for use in Relief Efforts
If you are a responder, or working with any organization that needs the most up-to-date geodata for the region, a consulting company called Geofabrik has set up a download site for OSM data that will be updated every 30 minutes throughout the HOTOSM activation. Find the data in various formats (including Garmin, Shapefile, etc...) here: [http://labs.geofabrik.de/nepal/](http://labs.geofabrik.de/nepal/)
