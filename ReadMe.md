#Map4Nepal@Stanford Resources	
**A link page for humanitarian mapping resources in response to the Nepal Earthquake**

This page is intended to be a place for me to put links to the resources I am paying attention to and using as I help volunteers at Stanford do humanitarian mapping in response to the Nepal Earthquake. If you find it useful, that's great. It's not authoritative, comprehensive or static.

Email me at stacemaples@stanford.edu if you need to.

#Mapping4Nepal@Stanford Introductory Workshops
I'll be updating this page as I schedule new workshops to introduce volunteers to the basics of using the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Task Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) and [Tomnod](http://www.tomnod.com/campaign/nepal_earthquake_2015/map/3f8x29y15) to contribute to relief mapping for Nepal.

###We are presenting Introduction to OpenStreetMap.org Relief Mapping for Nepal sessions on the following schedule:

###Wednesday, April 29th, from 5pm to 6pm  
at the Stanford Geospatial Center Teaching Corner in Branner Earth Science Library. Please RSVP at this link: http://www.eventbrite.com/e/map4nepal-introduction-to-openstreetmap-and-relief-mapping-tickets-16763516128

###Friday, May 1st, from 2pm to 3pm

##Mapping4Nepal@Stanford Introductory Workshops
I'll be updating this page as I schedule new workshops to introduce volunteers to the basics of using the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Task Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) and the [Tomnod](http://www.tomnod.com/campaign/nepal_earthquake_2015/map/3f8x29y15) to contribute to relief mapping for Nepal.

#Basic Information for Contributing **RIGHT NOW** 
###Working on OpenStreetMap Tasks
[General Info on the OSM Humanitarian Mapping effort](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_Nepal_earthquake): http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_Nepal_earthquake

If you want to contribute IMMEDIATELY to ongoing Humanitarian Mapping efforts for Nepal through Humanitarian OpenStreetMap.org, please do the following:

**First** go through the 30 minute training on http://mapgive.state.gov to learn the basics of humanitarian mapping using OpenStreetMap.org

**Then** go to the HOTOSM Task Manager at http://tasks.hotosm.org/ and select a job that you feel comfortable contributing to. Read the directions carefully for the job, then select one of the squares next to one that is marked as complete. This will allow you to pan to the completed square so you can see how others are digitizing the features and mimic their work. 

It doesn't matter how long you work, or how many features you digitize. There are currently hundreds of people mapping on HOTOSM for the Nepal Earthquake.Every edit counts.

###Additional Tutorials and HOTOSM Resources

* **Guidance for Mapping IDP (Internally Displaced People) Camps in the Nepal HOTOSM Tasks**  
http://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/guide/Nepal.html  
* **OpenStreetMap Wiki Nepal Remote Mapping Guide** This guide has image examples VERY HELPFUL!: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nepal_remote_mapping_guide

###Assessing Damage with **Tomnod**
You can also help assess damage, as new imagery becomes available. See [this DigitalGlobe post](http://www.digitalglobeblog.com/2015/04/26/digitalglobe-opens-access-to-satellite-data-to-support-disaster-response-efforts-in-nepal/) for information:

##Data Sources  
###Obtaining the latest OSM Data for use in Relief Efforts
If you are a responder, or working with any organization that needs the most up-to-date geodata for the region, a consulting company called Geofabrik has set up a download site for OSM data that will be updated every 30 minutes throughout the HOTOSM activation. Find the data in various formats (including Garmin, Shapefile, etc...) here: [http://labs.geofabrik.de/nepal/](http://labs.geofabrik.de/nepal/)
